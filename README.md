We are developing a lightweight, context-aware application firewall solution aimed at improving network security and anomaly detection for endpoint applications. The project includes:

Firewall Agent: Deployed on endpoints to monitor network traffic, manage application-specific firewall policies, and identify domains and protocols accessed by applications. Supports both Windows and Linux.

Centralized Web Management Console: A secure, web-based console that provides administrators with full control over application traffic, security policies, and abnormal behavior from anywhere, enabling centralized control of all endpoints.

Anomaly Detection: AI/ML techniques, specifically the Isolation Forest algorithm, are used to detect abnormal network behaviors in real time.

Secure Log Access: Logs are encrypted, with retrieval requiring both a password and a secondary email code. Data is stored in the cloud with real-time analysis.

Honeypot and Zero Trust Policies: Enhancing security by hiding the network and adopting a Zero Trust Policy.
